   UTILITIES
   ========================================================================== */

/**
 * Namespace: .u-classname
 *
 * The helpers, or “override” layer, should contain high-specificity selectors.
 * These are things like utility classes such as .u-hide, which can be reused
 * and are not tied to any specific piece of UI.
 *
 * VERY IMPORTANT: Please keep in mind the Single Responsibility Principle
 * when defining utility classes. Every class should do only one thing.
 * Utilities should be defined once, and never need changing.
 *
 * They are to be used as a last resort when no other CSS hooks are available,
 * or to tackle completely unique circumstances.
 *
 * They are only one step away from inline styles, so should be used sparingly.
 * If you are using a lot of utility classes you might be able to abstract them
 * out into a reusable Component or Object.
