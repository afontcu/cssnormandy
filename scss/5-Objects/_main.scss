/**
 * Namespace: .o-classname
 *
 * Contains the implementation of various design patterns such as de famous
 * media object. Objects are abstract, so they have no specific UI
 * implementation. They help us abstract out the repetitive, shared and
 * purely structural aspects of the UI into reusable objects.
 *
 * The idea is to keep these cosmetic-free in order to keep them reusable
 * across component instances and, ultimately, across projects.
 * That's why you would want to chose agnostic names that aren't specific to
 * the type of object. For example, choose .o-box over .o-profile-box.
 *
 * Please be really careful if you need to modify any attribute of an Object.
 * You probably shouldn't.
